        description: `Today technology is evolving at such a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, causing an acceleration of the rate of change, until eventually it will become exponential.
        Project implementation always makes use of the latest and more advanced technologies for controlling equipment and devices. Thus, this aspect of the project provides a platform for students to learn the rapid and emerging technologies which enriches knowledge on renewing technology.
        The project works accord the students to use what they have learned, and then to apply their skills on a particular real-time project. Hence, students are able to gain relative knowledge and enhance their skills with standard experimental techniques in both theoretical and practical aspects.`
